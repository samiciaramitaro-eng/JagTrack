My Classes for Next Quarter:
- A Block: [Jaca Script Q3] - [8:25-9:55]
- B Block: [Free Period] - [10:00-11:30]
- C Block: [AP Euro] - [12:15-1:45]
- D Block: [Algebra II] - [1:50-3:20]
I chose AP Euro because I am interested in the history behind Europe
and because I want to get a higher GPA. I am looking forward to pushing
myself by doing harder classes and making school more difficult. I think 
AP Euro will be the hardest and Algebra II following because it is my first
AP class. I would spend my free period finishing all of my work and maybe
taking a small break. These will help me reach my academic goal of a 4.0+
GPA.
