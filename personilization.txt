JagTrack Module 1 - Written Reflection

Option D
I chose the dark color theme since it matches what theme I chose for 
my browser and my whole computer entirely. I never really liked the light
theme or and colorful ones. The only other one I would consider would be
teal. Dark theme is simple and it makes everything way more readable.

I created a new calendar to help me stay organized by being able to see 
what will be due or assigned at a larger scale than canvas and also not
have to go on the website so much. So when choosing to go to one of my 
classes I can also see the calendar being more efficient. There weren't 
any challenges that I encountered it seemed fairly easy. I didn't 
cusotmize the appearance because it being white matches my themes. Month 
view seems to work the best. I might add a calendar for workouts and maybe
one for events.

My color theme that I had chosen was a dark red to bright red and white theme, because these are my favorite shades of red. I chose 
blood red and black and white for my dark theme because it gave the same vibe I got from my vs studio which had the same theme. It reminds 
me of the colors I have set as my windows theme also. The color choices reflect my style by the avatars I use and the calm demeanor they eminate.
I didn't use any color theory principles.The contrast worked properly with both the white text and the shades of red being very contrasted with
each other. I ensured good contrast by selecting the text color that appeared the most. I used no tools to pick these colors. Colors that didn't 
work were just red dark red and black, it obviously didn't appeal enough to the eye so.
I perfer a sunset theme to dark red theme. I always use dark mode rarely light mode so it is very helpful at night when you don't want to blind
yourself. I did not create any custom css for the button toggle.
Java script is what makes the webpage accesible, not the information, or the style of the website, but javascript creates the toggles, and 
everything that would require actual actions from a computer. ocalStorage is a web storage API in browsers that lets JavaScript store key-value
 pairs of data persistently on the user's device. When I click the theme toggle button it goes in either dark mode or light mode. The perference
 persists because of the local storage. I will use javascript to make toggle and navigation tools. 



Bootstrap Components Used:

Jumbotron – Used to create a hero section that highlights the student’s name and profile image at the top of the webpage.

Grid System (Container, Row, Columns) – Used to organize content and ensure the layout is responsive across different screen sizes.

Cards – Used to present hobbies, interests, and academic goals in a clear and structured format.

Accordion – Used in the Favorite Classes section to allow users to expand and collapse information for each class.

Progress Bars – Used to visually represent skill levels in an easy-to-understand way.

List Group – Used to display fun facts in a clean and organized list.

I chose specific Bootstrap components like cards, accordions, and progress bars because they organize information clearly and make the page
 easy to read. The layout starts with a hero section to grab attention and then moves into sections that gradually give more detail about me,
  which felt logical and clean. I used Bootstrap’s grid system to keep everything aligned and consistent across the page. One challenge I 
  faced was making sure the dark color theme still had good contrast, especially with text and cards. I am most proud of how the black, gold,
   and white theme makes the page look polished and professional while still being simple. This page reflects my personality because it is 
   organized, bold, and focused without being cluttered. If I had more time, I would add animations or a navigation bar for smoother 
   interaction. I ensured the page was responsive by using Bootstrap containers, rows, and columns so the layout adapts to different screen
    sizes.

Research and Problem-Solving

I used the Bootstrap documentation and W3Schools to learn how different components work and how to customize them. The hardest part was
 figuring out how to style Bootstrap components without breaking their default behavior. I had to troubleshoot issues with spacing and colors
  by inspecting elements and adjusting my CSS. Through this process, I learned how to research component options and apply them correctly 
  instead of guessing. My confidence with Bootstrap has grown from Module 1 to Module 2 because I now understand how to structure pages and 
  customize components more effectively.
